In this paper, I estimate that minority hosts on Airbnb, especially black and Asian hosts, earn \$5-\$9 less per day for the same type of listing as white hosts. This amounts to a yearly loss in revenue of \$100 - \$300. Importantly, I rule out several alternative hypotheses that could be driving these results, and show that racial discrimination is the explanation most consistent with my findings. 

Discrimination on the platform is pertinent as subject of research because Airbnb itself can do much to address these issues. 
In response to media outcry about allegations of discrimination, Airbnb updated its Discrimination Policy in September 2016, increasing instant bookings (the opportunity for guests to book without waiting for host approval) and making host profile pictures smaller. Evaluating Airbnb's efforts to address discrimination is therefore a relevant extension of this research. Since InsideAirbnb.com is continually being updated, there is now data available from webscrapes of listings after Airbnb's new discrimination policy took effect in September 2016. Future work can explore whether the policy helped curb discrimination on the platform by measuring the extent of discrimination before and after the policy took effect. If user interface really does influence the extent of discrimination in Airbnb, then the prices of minority and white hosts should start converging, suggesting that discrimination was causing the price disparities in the first place.
